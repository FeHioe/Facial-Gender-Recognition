# Facial-Gender-Recognition

A facial recognition and gender classification program that uses regression to identify the face and gender of celebrities. A set of 120 images per celebrity was used to train, validate and test the program. The resulting output is the accuracy of how well the program performed.

Linear regression was used to distingush male and female celebrities, and gradient descent was used for face recognition. To run the program, place both files in the same destination and run faces.py. 

Initial runtime of the program will be longer than usual, since the program is downloading, separating, and storing the images. Runtime after the first execution will be significantly faster.
